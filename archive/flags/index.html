    <p>The Wpwap “Star and Bars”, “Three stripes”, or any other variation of the Wpwapian flag as
        displayed in this folder can be used for any occasion, ceremony, or even as a simple decoration.
        The flag is proudly displayed during any government proceeding and is often accompanied by
        the Wpwap national anthem (although it is not necessary). Although the flags themselves are
        interchangeable, it is important not to forget the significance of each and every one of them and
        the different meanings they may hold depending on the context in which they are displayed.</p>
