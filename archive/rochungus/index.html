    <p>Although not directly a part of Wpwap, the Republic of Chungus is still a vital piece of Wpwapian
        history and serves as a grim reminder of what war can do to even the most powerful of
        governments. Shortly following Wpwap 9/11, the Discord server “deez” was created by
        “ricecakes”. This server had given Wpwap refugees a place to stay in a time of great confusion,
        and it was decided that “deez” would establish a special channel for former members of the
        Wpwapian government and their allies. This was included but not limited to, Jackie Cadman,
        Evelyn San Antonio, Aidan O’Sullivan, and others. The newly created, “Republic of Chungus”
        consisted of channels which served most of the basic functions that Wpwap served, including
        “bruh chungus chungus bruh fungus big chungus bruh bruh bruh chungus bruh chungus fungus
        big bungus”, often shortened to “bruh chungus” which was the main text channel. Other notable
        channels include, “Department of Sustice”, “Chunguston D.C”, “Santa Fe”, and “incel quotes”.
        Despite the somewhat deceiving channel names, no official government was ever constructed in
        “deez” or the “Republic of Chungus”, much to the refugees’ dismay. These channels have since
        gone dormant due to the revolution and subsequent return to Wpwap, followed by an almost
        immediate attempt to recover what was left of the government.</p>
