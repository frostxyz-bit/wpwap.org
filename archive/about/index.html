<p>Hello, and welcome to the Wpwap government documents archive. Here you can find just about
anything related to the Wpwapian government, including videos, photo, audio, and of course
documents. The archive is structured as a series of pages, with a page for each topic and, if
necessary, a subpage for a more specific topic. Everything in this archive has either been
declassified and censored after being approved for public viewing or is in the public domain.
This project was started on September 23, 2020, and as of the writing of this document, is still
being updated today. If you have any questions or comments regarding the validity of the
documents or anything in the archive, you can message me at frost#1633 on Discord, or visit
my website at <a href="https://frostt.xyz/">frostt.xyz</a> for more contact information. However, I kindly ask to please not come
towards me with unsolicited advice or ask for classified documents, as they will not be
answered.</p>
