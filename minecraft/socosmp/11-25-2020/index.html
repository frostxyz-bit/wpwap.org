    <p>The 25th was the first day that Wpwap decided to settle in the SocoSMP server. It is unknown what happened in the server before Wpwap had joined, but Soco along with his tightly-knit friend group had already set up camp. Initial operations were kept secret, but have since been disclosed and can be found in the W.I.A section of the archives. </p>
