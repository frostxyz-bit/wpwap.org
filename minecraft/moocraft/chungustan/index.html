    <p>Chungustan was the first base to be created after Liminal Africa on Moocraft, this time using /wild. The base consisted of mainly Billy, TJ, Rosha, Jackie, Jacob, Geret, and Evelyn. This base, similar to Liminal Africa, was short lived, however it was not the fault of any Wpwapian. Chungustan was griefed by the players hilaryclinton420 and leafster, according to user zwbw10. zwbw10 explained how leafster and hilaryclinton420 had begun griefing the base after zwbw10 was showing his friend around, and the two were killed before they could stop the attack. A detailed griefing summary is provided below for more information.</p>
