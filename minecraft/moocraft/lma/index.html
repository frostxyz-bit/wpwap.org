    <p>Liminal Africa was established shortly before the Wpwapian Renaissance, but still played a key role in determining the members of the Third Wpwapian Congress, and was comprised of all former members of Wpwap (with the exception of Rosha). After most of the base had been built, a plot was formed to hide and destroy Max's portion of Liminal Africa, which had not yet been completely finished. This resulted in Max leaking the base coordinates, and the base being destroyed within minutes.</p>
